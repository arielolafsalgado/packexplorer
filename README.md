packexplorer: Discover new r-packages with a easy going visualization

This package intends to facilitate the searching process of new interesting packages from the CRAN library. It provides an interfase build on leaflet, allowing to move around the packages' network, reading their descriptions, and finding groups of highly related packages. It also provides a system of recommendation, indicating relevant packages that directly relate to the ones you already installed.
